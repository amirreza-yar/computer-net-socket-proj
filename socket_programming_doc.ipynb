    "# Computer Networking: Socket programming assignment\n",
    "###### Sup. by Dr. Bazmi and implemented by Amirreza Yarahmadi\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "This assignment is about creating a client and a server that talk to each other using sockets. The client sends a name and number to the server, and the server replies with its name and an integer number, showing both numbers and their sum. If the client sends a number outside the range, the server shuts down. The main purpose is to validate the data recieved from the server, the sum of the numbers that are logged in server and client should be the same.\n",

    "The server waits for the client to connect. When the client connects, the server gets the client's name and a number. If the number is between 1 and 100, the server picks a random number and sends it back to the client, along with the server's name. The server also sends the sum of both numbers. If the client sends a number that is too big or too small, the server stops and closes the connection. Also it print logs for the user to see behind of the proccess. The logs that are indicated as \"DEBUG\" are the programming logs (ex. The server started on 0.0.0.0:8000) and \"INFO\" logs are the main output of these program. The server starts by running `start_socket_server.py` file. The logged output of this program after interacting with user looks like:"
